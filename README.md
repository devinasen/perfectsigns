# Perfect Signs
## A project developed for Data-X at Berkeley
### Authors: Aastha Jha, Devina Sen, Varsha Sundar

Perfect Signs uses Decision Tree Classification and Logistic Regressions to predict ideal Zodiac partners for a user based on their background, lifestyle preferences, and personality traits. Check it out at [http://perfectsigns.herokuapp.com](http://perfectsigns.herokuapp.com).

To run the application locally, you should only need to install python, dash, dash_bootstrap_components, pandas, numpy, and joblib. Refer to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/devinasen/perfectsigns/blob/master/requirements.txt) file for a full list of the necessary packages required to run all components of the project.

Run the application from the [index.py](https://github.com/devinasen/perfectsigns/blob/master/UI/index.py) file found in the UI folder using the command "python index.py" in your terminal. *Note: It is important to run the file from the UI directory due to relative pathing in the code.*

Majority of the UI code is adapted from the [dash tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [dash_bootstrap_components documentation](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/docs/) and the application structure follows the design found in [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-a-multipage-dash-application-eceac464de91) or this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/joelsewhere/dash_app) by Joel Collins.
